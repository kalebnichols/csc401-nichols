The application I am looking to build is a task manager, with this application people will be able to organize the tasks they need to complete each day.

The main component of this app is users will be able to create and delete tasks that need to be completed.  This will allow for users to compile a list of what needs to be done. With this, users will be able to give tasks a description, time duration expected to complete task, deadline date, importance of task, description of task, location, appointment time, and other possible qualities.

Other components that I am looking to incorpate in the app is being able to "check" a task off the list to indicate its completion, and a monthly, possibly yearly calendar that allows users to make plans/tasks for future dates. I would also like to develop a reminder system that reminds the user of tasks if they want a reminder, resembling an alarm type alert.
